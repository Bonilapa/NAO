# NAO
	I tried to install Java library to control NAO but I failed and put it for a long time.
During Lego PID hometask I failed several times to connect java with Lego-robot.
So I rejected the idea to control robot using Java at all. After that I decided to use Python and Eclipse.
But, for downloading a python library I need to register on NAO community site and I need to register
our university NAO on myself. So, in order to reduce possible difficulties with rights and property,
I rejected Eclipse use and decided to focus on in-built Python in Choreographe. So, from the initial
tools list there is only Choreographe left.
	I looked the Youtube course (https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCKM6TfIkSXO8-1pVAM1Fx_g) to try base methods
of robot control and using Python for it. And I still have difficulties with github.
	Also I started studying Aldebaran guide (http://doc.aldebaran.com/1-14/naoqi/motion/) API usage.
Initial plan:
	- Gathering information about robot-control
	- Taking resources
	- Testing in-build motions using simulation tools
	- Programming our own motions using simulation tools
	- Testing simulated motions using real robot-model
	- Presentation
Thus, at 29.03.18 I have completed first 3 items and started the 4th.
